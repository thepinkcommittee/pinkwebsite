	<hr class="rule">

	<p>Over many years at the University of Toronto and other Engineering schools, an informal "code of ethics" has evolved among students. This self-enforced attitude ensures that pranks will continue to be amusing and well-received both within the university community and beyond.</p>
	
	<hr class="rule">

	<p>According to the UofT "prankster ethic," a practical joke must:</p>
	
	<ul class="hacklist">
		<li class="hack-item"><div>be safe for everyone involved</div></li>
		<li class="hack-item"><div>not damage property or personal belongings</div></li>
		<li class="hack-item"><div>not harm anyone physically, mentally, or emotionally</div></li>
		<li class="hack-item"><div>be clever and amusing to most people who experience it</div></li>
		<li class="hack-item"><div>respect the academic environment and not disrupt learning</div></li>
		<li class="hack-item"><div>be easily reversible or temporary in nature</div></li>
	</ul>
	
	<hr class="rule">
	
	<p>There is no formal way of enforcing this code, but anything that directly contradicts these principles will likely not be considered a legitimate "prank" by the UofT community and wider. The best campus pranks are those that bring joy, spark conversation, and demonstrate creativity while maintaining respect for the people, property, and the academic environment.</p>
